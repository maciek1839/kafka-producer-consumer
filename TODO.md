# TODOs

- Offset examples
- Add Kafka Streams (kafka-streams) + consider new features from the latest release
- Use Spring Boot POM to manage dependencies
- SonarLint warnings
- Automate changelog generation (previously it was generated with an NPM library)
- Rearrange examples from all modules to play together into an Event Driven System (define business context)
- (Optional) Implementation for SSL/TLS Kafka
- (Optional) Add TestContainers tests for starters
